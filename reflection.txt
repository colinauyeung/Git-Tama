I probably worked on the project for probably about 15 hours. I think one of the things that I've learned through this assignment was the utility of using lego. Unlike like a lot of other material, lego allowed to really quickly prototype and tweak the build allowing to hone in the mechanical aspects of the build in very little time while still being sturdy enough to be reliable. It seems like a really obvious choice for building something like this, but I hadn't thought about it until I found myself playing with it while doing other things. One of the other things that I learned through this assignment was how touch and go servos are. They're fairly hard to calibrate and have that weird vibrating effect when the power isn't consistent. Also water is way heavier than you expect it to be. Even if a container is water tight and looks like it should carry water, if it's not designed to carry water, the weight can really mess with it. I think the major piece of advice I would give is to prototype everything at least once or twice. Things don't necessary behave the way they should all the time nor do they necessarily behave the same way together. For example, while our original power layout worked fine for the part individually, it started having issues when we put everything together and the water and the specific marbles we used changed how things looked dramatically. While we originally wanted more ripples and noise, these marbles aren't quite heavy enough to create that effect,  but have an interesting floating effect instead. So the other piece of advice I would give is to allow yourself to be surprised by the way things work together and use it to your advantage.
